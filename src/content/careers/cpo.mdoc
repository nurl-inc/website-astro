# Chief Product Officer (CPO)

_This is a **part-time equity only** role (until funding) with the potential of becoming a co-founder for the right candidate._

_It is the goal of Nurl to be fully funded in 2024. When that happens, this role will be re-negotiated to include salary and benefits in addition to the agreed upon equity during hire - with the expectation that the candidate will transition to full-time employment._

_This is the same commitment our Founder & CEO has been working since the birth of the company in 2023. We are a hive mentality that wins and loses together._

**Payment via equity** depending on role (i.e. CPO vs. Co-founder & CPO): 3-20%

If you love playing or running tabletop role-play games and are looking for a fresh start of being the CPO for a new tech startup that is looking to disrupt the industry - keep reading. If you have no experience or knowledge in TTRPG's - this post is not for you.

Nurl is a fast growing company that requires a high standard of quality results to set ourselves apart from the competition. This means you are a person who has the "inability to quit" and will do whatever it takes to solve a complex problem without compromising high quality standards (i.e. it's against your nature to give up). Likewise, this is an area you thrive - solving hard problems. Additionally, you are a person who still loves to code (and wants to) on a daily basis using progressive and advanced technology to solve problems. This is because at your core, you are a "lifelong-learner".

You are ready to change the TTRPG industry and want to be a part of that disruption for the betterment of our community.

This role is the 3rd hire of the team (outside of the technical Founder & CEO) so you will be working closely with them and openly contributing to the product evolution throughout the lifespan of the company.

## Responsibilities

- Design, strategize, and own the design and user-experience of Nurl
- Work part-time (or agreed upon hours) shipping product designs, user feedback, and anything else related - to the product experience.
- Attend weekly status meetings (virtual or in person depending on location)
- Attend investor meetings if/when needed (if founder qualified)
- Attend flexible project management meetings (anti-scrum/agile) in order to plan and meet goals
- Proactive communication on statuses and achieving goals

## Qualifications

- 10+ years in the industry, mainly focusing on product design and customer validation
- Experience with Penpot (our design tool) or Figma
- Experience with validating product experiences by talking to the customers (not sending out forms)
- Experience managing teams
- Experience working in startups
- Experience playing TTRPG games

## Gain Advantage

- Currently running or playing TTRPG games
- Experience with advanced AI features (i.e. not ChatGPT - think more like Notion)
