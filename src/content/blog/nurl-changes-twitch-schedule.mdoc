# Nurl Changes Twitch Schedule for February

## 2024-02-06

Nurl, the table-top RPG app for IRL or hybrid sessions where all your game tools now appear in one magical place, launched its own broadcast [channel](https://www.twitch.tv/nurl_app) on Twitch in late [December](https://nurl.website/blog/nurl-now-on-twitch). The company has been streaming every Thursday at 6PM CST.

To test other nights of the week for viewership, and because of the recent announcement about moving into app store development, Nurl will be changing Twitch streams to Wednesdays at 6PM CST beginning in February. It will also move to a bi-monthly broadcast instead of weekly.

> “I have thoroughly enjoyed connecting with our beta users weekly on Twitch – answering questions and showing how to maximize the app in their TTRPG world,” said [Casey Baggz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseybaggz/), Nurl founder and CEO. “But being a startup, I now need to focus our limited resources on a timely delivery of the next phase of Nurl.”

[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) is an American video live streaming service that focuses on video game live streaming, including broadcasts of esports competitions, in addition to offering music broadcasts, creative content, and "in real life" streams. Originally launched in 2011, Twitch today is a subsidiary of Amazon.

Fans can join Nurl Founder and CEO on Wednesday, February 8 and 22 at 6PM CST at [https://www.twitch.tv/nurl_app](https://www.twitch.tv/nurl_app). Broadcasts will feature development updates, bug fixes, merchandise sales, upcoming event information and Q&A with the app’s creator.
